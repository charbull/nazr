# Product Guide

## 1. Initial Concept

I want to build an android app that helps me remove distractions on my phone. I want it to allow the user to list apps to reduce usage on. And to put restrictions block the app after usage limit is reached. There should be an alpha numeric code to unblock the blocked app. The app can still run in the background and sends notifications but I cannot open it unblock it without a passcode (alphanumeric). Optimize for battery consumption, the new app must not drain the battery

## 2. Target Audience

The primary users of this application are individuals who are conscious of their digital habits and are actively seeking to reduce their overall screen time for improved digital wellbeing.

## 3. Core Features

The initial version of the application will focus on the following core features:

*   **App Selection:** A simple and intuitive interface for users to select the applications they wish to restrict.
*   **Usage Limits:** The ability to set specific time limits for the usage of selected apps on a daily or hourly basis.
*   **Blocking Mechanism:** A persistent blocking screen that is activated once the usage limit for an app is reached. This screen will prevent access to the app.
*   **Passcode Override:** Access to a blocked app will require a complex alphanumeric passcode, ensuring a deliberate action is taken to override the restriction.

## 4. Differentiators

The app will stand out from competitors by focusing on:

*   **Performance:** Being extremely lightweight and highly optimized for minimal battery consumption.
*   **User Experience:** Offering a highly customizable and aesthetically pleasing user interface.
*   **Insights:** Providing users with detailed statistics and reports on their app usage patterns to help them understand their habits.
