# Product Guidelines

## 1. Tone and Voice

The application's communication with the user should be **Encouraging and Supportive**. This means:
*   Using positive reinforcement to acknowledge user efforts and progress.
*   Framing restrictions and limitations as tools for empowerment and digital wellbeing.
*   Avoiding judgmental or overly prescriptive language.

## 2. Visual Identity

The desired visual identity for the app is **Clean and Minimalist**. This will translate to:
*   A focus on essential elements, avoiding unnecessary visual clutter.
*   A simple, intuitive layout that promotes ease of use.
*   A color palette that is calming and conducive to focus, without being overly distracting.

## 3. User Interaction Design

The primary principle guiding user interaction design is **Frictionless Setup**. This implies:
*   Minimizing the steps required for users to configure app restrictions and usage limits.
*   Providing clear and concise instructions for all features.
*   Ensuring a smooth and intuitive onboarding process.
