## Key Features

Nazr offers a suite of powerful features, all crafted with your focus in mind:

### Smart App Selection
Easily choose which applications you want to set limits for. Whether it's social media, games, or other time-consuming apps, Nazr gives you the power to decide what to control.

### Customizable Usage Limits
Set daily time limits for your chosen apps. Once you've reached your designated time, Nazr steps in to help you stay on track, allowing you to manage your screen time effectively.

### Intelligent Blocking Mechanism
When an app's usage limit is reached, Nazr implements a firm but fair blocking mechanism. Instead of simply closing the app, it presents a dedicated blocking screen, encouraging you to take a break.

### Motivational Interventions
Our enhanced blocking screen isn't just a barrier; it's a moment for reflection. When your time is up, you'll be greeted with:
*   A clear "Time limit reached!" message.
*   A short, 5-second "Loading..." delay, providing a brief pause.
*   A thoughtfully selected motivational quote to inspire you to stay focused or engage in other activities.

### Secure Passcode Override
We understand that sometimes you need temporary access. Nazr allows you to temporarily unblock an application by entering a secure alphanumeric passcode. You can choose to unblock for a few minutes or longer, giving you the flexibility you need while still maintaining control.

### Settings Protection
To ensure your commitment to digital wellbeing isn't easily circumvented, Nazr offers robust passcode protection for critical settings:
*   **Changing Usage Limits:** Modify an app's time limit only after entering your passcode and confirming your decision, preventing impulsive changes.
*   **Deactivating App Restrictions:** If you wish to remove a restriction from an app, you'll need to verify your identity with a passcode, ensuring mindful choices.

### Streamlined First-Time Setup
Getting started with Nazr is designed to be smooth and intuitive. When you're configuring the app for the first time or if no passcode is set, the process of setting usage limits is simplified, allowing you to quickly establish your preferences without unnecessary confirmations.

## Benefits

By using Nazr, you can expect to:
*   **Reduce Screen Time:** Consciously manage how long you spend on distracting apps.
*   **Improve Focus & Productivity:** Minimize interruptions and dedicate more time to meaningful tasks.
*   **Enhance Digital Wellbeing:** Build healthier relationships with your devices and enjoy a more balanced life.
*   **Maintain Control:** Take charge of your phone usage with smart, secure, and flexible tools.

Nazr is here to support you in creating a more intentional and less distracted digital life.
